# TType: a terminal typing game
Practice typing lower case, upper case, and capital letters by completing randomized prompts. Select your own ratio of the three character types to train your weaker areas.

## How to play
Run the provided shell script (`CRTType.sh`) by typing
> user@machine:~/.../$ ./CRTType.sh
OR
Compile the source code (`TType.c`) using your compiler of choice and run the executable.
You have 100 percentage points to allocate between the different character types. A larger allocation means that character type is more likely (allocating 50 to special characters means approximately half of random characters will be a special character). **All allocations must add up to 100.**
